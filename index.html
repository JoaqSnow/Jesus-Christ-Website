  <section class="main-section" id="Who_Is_He"><header>Who Is He</header>
  <article> <p>Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior. Jesus, also known as Jesus of Nazareth, is a central figure in Christianity, Islam, and other religious traditions. Born in the first century BC in Bethlehem, he is considered the Son of God and the awaited Messiah in Christianity. Christians believe he was crucified and resurrected, offering salvation and eternal life to humanity. In Islam, Jesus is regarded as a prophet and the Messiah, but not as a divine being. Other religions, such as the Baháʼí Faith and Druze, also revere him. Jews do not accept Jesus as the Messiah, arguing that he did not fulfill the prophesies and was not lawfully anointed.</p> </article>

   <article><p>Jesus is central to the Christian belief in redemption and salvation. Through his life, teachings, and especially his death and resurrection, Jesus is seen as the means through which humanity can be redeemed from sin and achieve eternal life. Also the resurrection of Jesus is considered the cornerstone of the Christian faith. Without it, the Christian message would lack credibility (1 Corinthians 15:17). The resurrection is seen as evidence of Jesus’ divine nature and his victory over death (Revelation 1:17-18)</p></article>

  <section class="main-section" id="His_Impact_On_Us"><header>His Impact On Us</header>
   <article><p>Jesus' teachings on love, forgiveness, and compassion have profoundly influenced individuals and movements throughout history, inspiring efforts to advance social justice and care for the marginalized. His revolutionary emphasis on unconditional love and empathy encouraged people to challenge societal norms, dismantle injustices, and advocate for the welfare of the vulnerable. From movements opposing slavery and colonialism to those championing civil rights and poverty alleviation, his message has been a guiding force, urging individuals to see the inherent dignity and worth of every human being.</p>

   <p>One particularly revolutionary aspect of Jesus' ministry was his emphasis on treating women and children with dignity and respect, a stark contrast to the cultural norms of his time. In an era when women and children were often regarded as second-class citizens or entirely disregarded, his interactions reflected radical inclusion and value. He engaged with women as equals, entrusted them with significant roles, and blessed children, highlighting their spiritual importance. This approach has left a lasting legacy, challenging societal structures and inspiring efforts for gender equality and the protection of children's rights.</p>
   <p>Although not an artist, poet, or musician himself, Jesus has served as a profound source of inspiration for some of history's greatest creators. Artists like Raphael, Michelangelo, and Leonardo da Vinci drew upon his life and teachings to craft breathtaking masterpieces. Poets such as Dante and Milton composed works that wrestle with spiritual themes rooted in his story. Composers like Haydn, Handel, Beethoven, Bach, and Mendelssohn created timeless music reflecting their awe for his legacy. This artistic lineage reflects how his life resonates universally, transcending generations, mediums, and cultures.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Bible_Scriptures"><header>Bible Scriptures</header>
   <article>
    <p>In the Bible, many types of scriptures capture the words and teachings of Jesus, revealing profound truths about faith, humanity, and the nature of God. These scriptures serve as foundational principles that Jesus preached consistently, emphasizing the importance of love, humility, and obedience to God's will. His messages often called people to examine their hearts, seek reconciliation, and live lives reflective of God's character. Through parables, sermons, and everyday conversations, Jesus illuminated deep spiritual wisdom in ways that were accessible to all, from scholars to ordinary people.</p> 
<p>One of the recurring themes in Jesus' teachings is the centrality of love as the highest commandment. In passages such as Matthew 22:37-39, Jesus states that loving God with all your heart, soul, and mind, and loving your neighbor as yourself, summarizes the entire law and the prophets. He also challenged people to extend love even to their enemies, as seen in Matthew 5:44, demonstrating how transformative and boundless love can be. These teachings continue to encourage followers to live selflessly, building bridges of understanding and compassion across social, cultural, and religious divides.</p>
<p>Another powerful motif in Jesus' preaching is forgiveness and the call to repentance. He often emphasized God's willingness to forgive sins and encouraged his followers to do the same toward others. For instance, in Matthew 6:14-15, Jesus explains the interconnectedness of forgiving others and receiving forgiveness from God. His parable of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32) underscores God's enduring mercy and readiness to welcome back those who turn from wrongdoing. These repeated teachings remind us of the hope and restoration available through grace, inspiring believers to embrace a life of forgiveness and reconciliation with others and with God.</p>
<p>Listed below are few other scriptures to hold onto and some of my favorites</p>

     <ul>
       <li>Proverbs 3:5-6: Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understadning. In all your ways sumbit to him and he will keep your path straight.</li>
       <li>John 3:16: For God so loved the world he gave his one and only son , that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have etranl life</li>
       
       <li> John 14:24: “Jesus answered, ‘If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him.’”</li>

  <li>   John 16:25: “These things I have spoken to you in figures of speech. The hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech but will tell you plainly about the Father.”</li>
<li>Matthew 23:37: “O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not!”</li>
